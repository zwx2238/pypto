# PyPTO Git Commit Workflow

## Task Tracking

Create tasks to track progress through this workflow:

1. Code simplification (optional)
2. Analyze changes & launch review/test agents
3. Address issues from review/testing
4. Stage changes & commit
5. Post-commit verification

## Step 0: Optional Code Simplification

**Before reviewing and committing, ask the user if they want to simplify the changed code first.**

> Run code simplification before committing? This refines your changed code for clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving all functionality. May take extra time.

If the user agrees, review and simplify the changed code. Then proceed to Prerequisites.

If the user declines, skip directly to Prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

**Check what changed to determine which agents to run:**

```bash
git diff --name-only
git diff --cached --name-only
```

**Determine testing needs based on changed files:**

| File Types Changed | Run Code Review | Run Testing | Run Clang-Tidy |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| C++ (`.cpp`, `.h`) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Python (`.py`, bindings, tests) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ Skip |
| Build system (`.cmake`, `CMakeLists.txt`) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Docs only (`.md`, `.rst`, `docs/`) | ✅ Yes | ❌ Skip | ❌ Skip |
| Config only (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.github/`) | ✅ Yes | ❌ Skip | ❌ Skip |
| Mixed (code + docs/config) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | If C++ changed |

**Launch appropriate agents IN PARALLEL:**

- **`code-reviewer`** - ALWAYS run for all changes
- **`testing`** - ONLY run if code files changed
- **`clang-tidy`** - Run `python tests/lint/clang_tidy.py --diff-base HEAD` if C++ files changed (via Bash agent)

## Workflow

1. Analyze changed files to determine testing needs
2. Launch in parallel (single message with multiple Task tool calls):
   - **code-reviewer** agent (always)
   - **testing** agent (if code changed)
   - **clang-tidy** via Bash agent: `python tests/lint/clang_tidy.py --diff-base HEAD` (if C++ changed)
3. Wait for all agents to complete
4. Address any issues found
5. Stage changes
6. Generate commit message
7. Commit and verify

## Stage Changes

**Related changes together**:

```bash
git add path/to/file1.cpp path/to/file2.h
git diff --staged  # Review
```

**Cross-layer pattern** (C++ + Python + Type stubs + Tests):

```bash
git add include/pypto/ir/expr.h python/bindings/ir_binding.cpp \
        python/pypto/pypto_core/__init__.pyi tests/ut/ir/test_expr.py
```

**Never stage**: Build artifacts (`build/`, `*.o`), temp files, IDE configs

## Commit Message Format

**Structure**: `type(scope): description (≤72 chars)`

**Types**: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, style, chore, perf
**Scope**: Module/component (ir, printer, builder)
**Description**: Present tense, action verb, no period

**Good examples**:

```text
feat(ir): Add unique identifier field to MemRef
fix(printer): Update printer to use yield_ instead of yield
refactor(builder): Simplify tensor construction logic
test(ir): Add edge case coverage for structural comparison
```

**Bad examples** (avoid):

```text
❌ feat(ir): Added feature.  # Past tense, has period
❌ Fix bug                   # Missing type prefix
❌ WIP                       # Not descriptive
```

## Commit

```bash
# Short message
git commit -m "feat(ir): Add tensor rank validation"

# Detailed message (in editor)
git commit
```

**In editor**:

```text
feat(ir): Add tensor rank validation

Validates tensor rank is positive before setting shape.
Raises ValueError for invalid ranks.
Updates tests with edge case coverage.
```

## Co-Author Policy

**❌ NEVER add AI assistants**: No Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor AI, etc.
**✅ Only credit human contributors**: `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`

**Why?** AI tools are not collaborators. Commits reflect human authorship.

## Post-Commit Verification

```bash
git show HEAD              # View commit
git log -1                 # Check message
git show HEAD --name-only  # Verify files
```

**Fix issues** (only if not pushed):

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Corrected message"      # Fix message
git add file && git commit --amend --no-edit   # Add forgotten file
```

⚠️ **Only amend unpushed commits!**

## Checklist

- [ ] Changed files analyzed (code vs docs/config only)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Tests passed (if code changed) or skipped (if docs/config only)
- [ ] Clang-tidy passed (if C++ changed) or skipped (if no C++)
- [ ] Only relevant files staged
- [ ] No build artifacts
- [ ] Message format: `type(scope): description` (≤72 chars, present tense, no period)
- [ ] No AI co-authors

## Remember

A good commit is thoroughly reviewed, groups related changes, has clear "why" message, and attributes only human authors.
