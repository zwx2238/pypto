# PyPTO Issue Fix Workflow

Fetch GitHub issue, create branch, plan, and implement the fix.

## Task Tracking

Create tasks to track progress through this workflow:

1. Fetch issue & create branch
2. Plan the fix
3. Implement the fix
4. Run tests
5. Commit changes
6. Create PR (optional)

## Workflow

1. Check gh CLI authentication
2. Fetch issue content
3. Assign issue to me
4. Create issue branch
5. Enter plan mode to design fix
6. Implement the fix
7. Run tests (use `testing` skill)
8. Commit changes (use `git-commit` skill)
9. Create PR (optional, use `github-pr` skill)

## Step 1: Check gh CLI Authentication

```bash
gh auth status
```

**If not authenticated**, prompt user:

```text
gh CLI is not authenticated. Please run: gh auth login
```

⚠️ **Stop here if not authenticated** - user must login first.

## Step 2: Fetch Issue Content and Comments

```bash
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --json number,title,body,state,labels
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --comments
```

**Parse**: Issue number, title, description, state (open/closed), labels, and all comments.

Comments often contain clarifications, reproduction steps, or design decisions that are critical for understanding the full context of the issue.

**If issue is closed**: Ask user if they still want to work on it.

## Step 3: Assign Issue to Me

Before assigning, check if someone is already working on the issue:

```bash
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --json assignees --jq '.assignees[].login'
```

**If assigned to current user**: Continue — already claimed.

**If assigned to someone else**: Ask the user whether to proceed or pick a different issue.

**If unassigned**: Assign to yourself (best-effort — skip gracefully if permissions are insufficient):

```bash
gh issue edit ISSUE_NUMBER --add-assignee @me
```

If the assignment fails due to permissions (common on forks or some org repos), continue with the workflow — do not block.

## Step 4: Create Issue Branch

**Branch naming**: `issue-{number}-{short-description}`

```bash
git checkout main && git pull upstream main
ISSUE_NUM=123
BRANCH_NAME="issue-${ISSUE_NUM}-fix-tensor-validation"
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

## Step 5: Enter Plan Mode

Use `EnterPlanMode` to design the fix.

**Plan should cover**:

- Root cause analysis (for bugs)
- Files that need changes
- Implementation strategy
- Testing approach
- Documentation updates
- Cross-layer changes (C++, Python, type stubs)

## Step 6: Implement the Fix

After plan approval, follow PyPTO conventions:

1. Make code changes following plan
2. Follow `.claude/rules/` conventions
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Add/update tests
5. Maintain cross-layer sync (C++, Python, type stubs)

## Step 7: Run Tests

```text
/testing
```

Fix any failures before committing.

## Step 8: Commit Changes

```text
/git-commit
```

**Commit message format**:

```text
fix(scope): Brief description

Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER

Detailed explanation of the fix.
```

## Step 9: Create PR (Optional)

```text
/github-pr
```

**PR must reference issue**: "Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER"

## Common Issue Types

| Type | Approach |
| ---- | -------- |
| Bug fix | Reproduce, root cause, fix, add regression test |
| Feature request | Plan API design, implement, add tests and docs |
| Refactoring | Plan changes, ensure tests pass, maintain API |
| Documentation | Fix/improve docs, verify examples work |
